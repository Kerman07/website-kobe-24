			<h2><strong>Dear</strong> Basketball,</h2>
			<div>
				<hr>
				<div>
					From the moment<br>
					I started rolling my dad&apos;s tube socks<br>
					And shooting imaginary<br>
					Game-winning shots<br>
					In the Great Western Forum<br>
					I knew one thing was real:				
				</div>
				<br>
				<hr>
 				<div>
 					I fell in love with you.
 					<hr>
 					<p>
 						A love so deep I gave you my all &minus;<br>
						From my mind & body<br>
						To my spirit & soul.
 					</p>
 				</div>
 				<hr>
 				<div>
 					As a six-year-old boy<br>
					Deeply in love with you<br>
					I never saw the end of the tunnel.<br>
					I only saw myself<br>
					Running out of one.<br>
 				</div>
 				<br>
 				<hr>
 				<div>
					And so I ran.<br>
					I ran up and down every court<br>
					After every loose ball for you.<br>
					You asked for my hustle<br>
					I gave you my heart<br>
					Because it came with so much more.<br>
 				</div>
 				<br>
 				<hr>
 				<div>
					I played through the sweat and hurt<br>
					Not because challenge called me<br>
					But because YOU called me.<br>
					I did everything for YOU<br>
					Because that&apos;s what you do<br>
					When someone makes you feel as<br>
					Alive as you&apos;ve made me feel.<br> 					
 				</div>
 				<br>
 				<hr>
 				<div>
 					You gave a six-year-old boy his Laker dream<br>
					And I&apos;ll always love you for it.<br>
					But I can&apos;t love you obsessively for much longer.<br>
					This season is all I have left to give.<br>
					My heart can take the pounding<br>
					My mind can handle the grind<br>
					But my body knows it&apos;s time to say goodbye.<br>
 				</div>
 				<br>
 				<hr>
 				<div>
					And that&apos;s OK.<br>
					I&apos;m ready to let you go.<br>
					I want you to know now<br>
					So we both can savor every moment we have left<br>together.<br>
					The good and the bad.<br>
					We have given each other<br>
					All that we have.<br>		
 				</div>
 				<br>
 				<hr>
 				<div>
					And we both know, no matter what I do next<br>
					I&apos;ll always be that kid<br>
					With the rolled up socks<br>
					Garbage can in the corner<br>
					:05 seconds on the clock<br>
					Ball in my hands.<br>
					5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1<br>
 				</div>
 				<br>
 				<hr>
 				<div>
 					Love you always,<br>
						Kobe<br>
 				</div>
